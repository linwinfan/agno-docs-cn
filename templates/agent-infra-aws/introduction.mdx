sidebarTitle: Introduction
---

The Agent Infra AWS template provides a standardized codebase for running AgentOS on AWS. This template uses `agno-infra` SDK to manage the local and AWS deployment.

### Local environment

Runs both AgentOS and PostgreSQL using Docker.

Ideal for development, testing, and verifying your setup before deploying to the cloud.

### AWS environment

AgentOS is deployed on ECS while the image is built and pushed to AWS ECR.

PostgreSQL is provisioned via RDS for reliable, managed database hosting.

The template automates infrastructure creation and deployment steps using agno-infra.

### How to get started

- Clone the template repository and install the dependencies
- Start with the local setup to ensure everything works end-to-end.
- Move to AWS deployment using the provided guides once your local environment is ready.

You can also clone the template directory and follow the instructions in the template documentation.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash terminal
  git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-aws.git cd
  agent-infra-aws 
  ```

</CodeGroup>

After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker.
