The Agent Infra Docker template delivers a production-ready Docker Compose configuration and Dockerfile designed to deploy AgentOS reliably across diverse infrastructure environments. Packaged as a standard containerized system, it provides full flexibility to run anywhere containers are supported.

For example, you can deploy it to cloud providers like:

- [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
- [Google Cloud Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute-engine/)
- [Azure virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/)

Or Platforms like:

- [Modal](https://modal.com/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

This template gives you the freedom to deploy AgentOS on any infrastructure of your choice.

For a purpose-built, AWS optimized deployment, refer to the [Agent Infra AWS template](/templates/agent-infra-aws/introduction), which demonstrates how to operationalize AgentOS in production on AWS using ECS. Or, for a simple and fast deployment method, refer to the [Agent Infra Railway template](/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction), which demonstrates how to operationalize AgentOS in production on Railway.
