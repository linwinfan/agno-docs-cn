The Agent Infra Docker template provides a simple Docker Compose file for running AgentOS locally.

### Local environment

Runs both AgentOS and PostgreSQL using Docker.

Ideal for development, testing, and verifying your setup before deploying to the cloud.

### Production environment

Since this template provides you with a Dockerfile and Docker Compose file, you can easily deploy it to any cloud provider that supports Docker. Or you could deploy it to one of the Hosted Platforms like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Render](https://render.com/). For Railway, you can use the [Agent Infra Railway template](/templates/agent-infra-railway/introduction) to deploy your AgentOS.

### How to get started

- Clone the template repository and install the dependencies
- Start with the local setup to ensure everything works end-to-end.
- Move to the cloud provider of your choice using the provided guides once your local environment is ready.

Or, you can clone the repository and follow the instructions in the template documentation.

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-infra-docker.git
cd agent-infra-docker
```

After creating your codebase, the next step is to get it up and running locally using docker
