The Agent Infra Railway template provides a simple Railway project for running AgentOS.

### Local environment

Runs both AgentOS and PostgreSQL using Docker Desktop.

Ideal for development, testing, and verifying your setup before deploying to the cloud.

### Production environment

AgentOS is deployed on Railway using the Dockerfile and a PgVector template is used as the database

The template automates infrastructure creation and deployment steps using a single script.

### How to get started

- Clone the template repository and install the dependencies
- Start with the local setup to ensure everything works end-to-end.
- Move to Railway deployment using the provided guides once your local environment is ready.
