description: 学习使用 In-Memory 存储 for your Agents
---

Agno 支持 using In-Memory 存储 with the `InMemoryDb` class. By doing this, you will be able to use all 特性 that depend on having a 数据库, without having to set one up.

<Warning>
Using the In-Memory 存储 is not recommended for production applications.
Use it for demos, testing and any other use case where you don't want to setup a 数据库.
</Warning>

## 使用方法

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.in_memory import InMemoryDb

# Setup in-memory database
db = InMemoryDb()

# Create agent with database
agent = Agent(db=db)
```
